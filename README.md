# A-Frame 3D slideshow example

Demo of how to create 3D-Slide-Shows using A-Frame.

## Components used

- [A-Frame HTML-Embed](https://github.com/supereggbert/aframe-htmlembed-component) for rendering HTML-Slides inside A-Frame.
- [A-Frame Presentation](https://github.com/rvdleun/aframe-presentation-component) for defining the flow of the slideshow through 3D-space.
- [A-Frame Environment](https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-environment-component) for adding some spice


## Room for improvement

- I manually determined the viewing position for each slide
- You might want to automatically determine the viewing positions based on the slide positions.
